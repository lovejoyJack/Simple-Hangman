Features: 

The program loads words from words.txt.
Words are sorted alphabetically before being used in the game.
The user can guess letters and try to figure out the word.
A simple user interface with text-based input/output.
How It Works
Word Selection: Words are read from words.txt, sorted alphabetically, and one word is chosen randomly.
Gameplay: The user guesses letters to try and figure out the hidden word. The program shows how many letters are correctly guessed and how many are still missing.
End of Game: The game ends when the user guesses the word or exhausts the number of allowed attempts.

Project Focus: 

This project focuses on the approach to solving the Hangman game problem rather than the end results. It demonstrates:
File handling in Java.
Sorting and random selection of words.
Basic game logic and user interaction.
